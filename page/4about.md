![Yayun](/assets/images/about_me.png)

Welcome to my blog!

I'm Yayun Liu, also known as Aaron. I reside in Austin, TX, together with my wife Wendy and our two sons, Jeremiah and Enoch.

Professionally, I am a Principal System Engineer at Dell Technologies, focusing on network devices in Dell enterprise servers.

In May 2023, I embarked on this blogging journey with the aim of documenting my learnings and sharing valuable insights with the community.

While my spare time is limited, I cherish the few hobbies that I have.
